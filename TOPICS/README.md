# 🧠 React Complete Concepts (2025)

A structured guide covering everything in React — from fundamentals to Next.js ecosystem.


## 🧩 1️⃣ Core React Fundamentals

The foundation — everything React is built on.

JSX  
Components (Function, Class)

## ⚙️ 2️⃣ React Component Lifecycle

How React mounts, updates, and unmounts components.

Lifecycle Phases:  
Mounting (constructor, componentDidMount)  
Updating (shouldComponentUpdate, componentDidUpdate)  
Unmounting (componentWillUnmount)

useEffect → Mount/Update/Unmount  
Cleanup functions in useEffect  
Dependency array behavior

---

## 🎯 4️⃣ React Forms & Input Handling

Data entry, validation, and form control.

Controlled Components (React manages input state)

Concurrent Mode & Suspense  
React Profiler

---

## 🧱 7️⃣ Routing & Navigation

Moving between pages or views.

React Router DOM  
<Routes>, <Route>, <Link>  
Dynamic routes (/user/:id)  
Nested routes  
Protected routes  
Redirects (Navigate)  
URL params & query params  
Lazy loading with routes  
Scroll restoration

---

## 🧰 8️⃣ Working with APIs & Data Fetching

Connecting React to backends.

fetch() API  
Axios  
Handling loading & error states  
useEffect for API calls  
Canceling fetch requests  
React Query (TanStack Query)  
Query caching, invalidation, prefetching  
SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate pattern)  
GraphQL (Apollo Client, Relay)  
WebSockets / Live updates

---

## 🧩 9️⃣ Refs & DOM Manipulation

Accessing or controlling DOM elements directly.

useRef basics  
Forwarding refs (forwardRef)  
useImperativeHandle  
Accessing child component functions  
Storing previous state with refs  
Measuring elements (getBoundingClientRect)

---

## 🧠 🔟 Advanced Patterns & Architecture

Scalable code structure and reusable patterns.

Higher-Order Components (HOCs)  
Render Props pattern  
Compound Components  
Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components  
Custom Hooks pattern  
State Reducer pattern  
Provider pattern (for context)  
Error Boundaries  
Portals (render outside DOM tree)  
Code splitting by routes and components  
Context Module pattern  
Function composition in React  
Component composition vs inheritance

---

## 🧪 11️⃣ Testing & Debugging

Ensuring your React works correctly.

React Testing Library (RTL)  
Jest  
Mocking API calls  
Snapshot testing  
Integration testing  
Cypress / Playwright (E2E)

---

## 🌐 12️⃣ CSS & Styling in React

Ways to style your app.

CSS Modules  
Inline Styles  
Styled Components  
Emotion  
Tailwind CSS  
Sass / SCSS

CSS-in-JS performance considerations

---

## 🏗️ 13️⃣ Rendering Strategies

How and when React renders.

Client-Side Rendering (CSR)  
Server-Side Rendering (SSR)  
Static Site Generation (SSG)  
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
